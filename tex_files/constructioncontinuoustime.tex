In Section~\ref{sec:constr-discr-time} we considered time in discrete `chunks':
minutes, hours, days, and so on. For given numbers of arrivals and
capacity per period we use the recursions~\eqref{eq:31} to
compute the departures and queue length per period.  However, we can also model time in a continuous way, and assume that jobs can come in at any moment.
In this section we consider a single-server FIFO queueing process in continuous time. 

Assume we are given, as basic data, the \recall{arrival process}
$\{A(t); t\geq 0\}$: the number of jobs that arrived during $[0,t]$.
Thus, $\{A(t); t\geq 0\}$ is a \emph{counting process}.

From this arrival process we can derive various other interesting
concepts, such as the arrival times of individual jobs. Specially, if
we know that $A(s) = k-1$ and $A(t) = k$, then the arrival time $A_k$
of the $k$th job must lie somewhere in $(s,t]$. Thus, from $\{A(t)\}$, we can define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:27}
  A_k = \inf\{t: A(t) \geq k\},
\end{equation}
and set $A_0 = 0$. Once we have the set of arrival times $\{A_k\}$,
the \recall{inter-arrival times} $\{X_k, k=1, 2, \ldots\}$ between
consecutive customers can be constructed as
\begin{equation}
  X_k = A_k - A_{k-1}.
\end{equation}

Often the basic data consists of the inter-arrival times
$\{X_k; k=1,2,\ldots\}$ rather than the arrival times $\{A_k\}$ or
the arrival process~$\{A(t)\}$. Then we  construct the arrival
times as
\begin{equation*}
  A_k = A_{k-1} + X_k,
\end{equation*}
with $A_0 = 0$.  From the arrival times $\{A_k\}$ we can, in
turn, construct the arrival process $\{A(t)\}$ as 
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:2}
\begin{equation}
  A(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{A_k \leq t},
\end{equation}
where $\1{\cdot}$ is the indicator function. Thus, in the above we count
all arrivals that occur up to and including time~$t$. Another, equivalent, way to
define $A(t)$ is\footnote{For the mathematically inclined: formally we should use here $\sup$ rather than $\max$. However, in any practical setting such details are irrelevant. Hence we ignore them.}
\begin{equation}
  A(t) = \max\{k: A_k \leq t\}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Clearly, we see that from the inter-arrival times $\{X_k\}$ it is
possible to construct $\{A_k\}$ and $\{A(t)\}$, and the other way
around, from $\{A(t)\}$ we can find $\{A_k\}$ and $\{X_k\}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:waitingtimegg1} shows these relations graphically. To
memorize this, it may be helpful to write it like this:
\begin{align*}
  A_k : \N \to \R, \quad{\text{job id (integer) to arrival time (real number)}}, \\
  A(t) : \R\to \N, \quad{\text{time (real number) to number of jobs (integer)}}.
\end{align*}

\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
 What are  the meanings of $A_{A(t)}$ and $A(A_n)$?
 \begin{solution}
  $A(t)$ is the number of arrivals during $[0,t]$. Suppose that
    $A(t) = n$. This $n$th job arrived at time $A_n$. Thus, $A_{A(t)}$
    is the arrival time of the last job that arrived before or at time
    $t$. In a similar vein, $A_n$ is the arrival time of the $n$th
    job. Thus, the number of arrivals up to time $A_n$, i.e., $A(A_n)$,
    must be $n$.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]\label{ex:22}
  In view of the above, can  $A(t)$ be defined as $\min\{k : A_k \geq t\}$ or as $\min\{k: A_k > t\}$?
  \begin{hint}
Compare this to the definition in (\ref{eq:2}).
  \end{hint}
  \begin{solution}
    Suppose $A_3 = 10$ and $A_4 = 20$. Take $t=15$. Then
    $\min\{k : A_k \geq 15\} = 4$ since $A_3 < t=15 < A_4$. On the
    other hand $\max\{k : A_k \leq t\} = 3$. And, indeed, at time $t=15$, 3 jobs arrived, not 4. So defining $A(t)$ as $\min\{k : A_k \geq t\}$ is not OK.  This example also shows that in general $A(t) \neq \min\{k : A_k > t\}$. So, neither definition is correct. 

  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

To compute the departure times $\{D_k\}$ we proceed in stages.
The first stage is to construct the \recall{waiting time in queue} $\{W_{Q,k}\}$ as seen by the arrivals.
Observe in Figure~\ref{fig:waitingtimegg1} that the waiting time of the $k$th arrival must be equal to the waiting time of the $k-1$th customer plus the amount of \recall{service time} required by job $k-1$ minus the time that elapses between the arrival of job $k-1$ and job $k$, unless the server becomes idle between jobs $k-1$ and $k$.
In other words,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:56}
  W_{Q,k} = [W_{Q,k-1} + S_{k-1}-X_k]^+,
\end{equation}
where $[x]^+ = \max\{x, 0\}$. If we set $W_{Q,0}=0$, we can compute
$W_{Q,1}$ from this formula, and then $W_{Q,2}$ and so on.

\caption{Construction of the single-server queue in continuous time. The
  sojourn time~$W_{k}$ of the~$k$th job is the sum of the work in queue~$W_{Q,k}$ at its arrival epoch~$A_k$ and its service time~$S_k$;
  its departure time is then $D_k=A_k + W_k$. The waiting time of job
  $k$ is clearly equal to $W_{k-1}-X_{k}$. We also see that job~$k+1$
  arrives at an empty system, hence its sojourn time
  $W_{k+1}=S_{k+1}$. Finally, the virtual waiting time process is
  shown by the lines with slope~$-1$.}
  \label{fig:waitingtimegg1}
\end{figure}

The time job $k$ \emph{leaves the queue and moves to the server} is
\begin{equation*}
 \tilde A_k = A_k + W_{Q,k},
\end{equation*}
because a job can only move to the server after its arrival plus the
time it needs to wait in queue.  Note that we here explicitly use the
FIFO assumption.

Right after the job moves from the queue to the server, its service starts.  Thus,~$\tilde A_{k}$ is the epoch at which the service of job~$k$ starts. After completing its service,
the job leaves the system. Hence, the \recall{departure time of the
  system} is
\begin{equation*}
  D_k = \tilde A_{k} + S_k.
\end{equation*}

The \recall{sojourn time}, or \emph{waiting time in the system}, $W_k$, is the
time a job spends in the entire system. With the above relations we
see that
\begin{equation}
  W_k = D_k - A_k = \tilde A_{k} + S_k -A_k = W_{Q,k} + S_k,
\end{equation}
where each of these equations has its own interpretation. 

A bit of similar reasoning gives another recursion for~$W_k$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:59}
  W_{Q,k} &= [W_{k-1} - X_k]^+, &
  W_{k} &= W_{Q,k} + S_k = [W_{k-1} - X_k]^+ + S_k,
\end{align}
from which follows a recursion for $D_k$:
\begin{equation}
  D_k = A_k + W_k.
\end{equation}
This in turn specifies the departure process $\{D(t)\}$ as
\begin{equation*}
  D(t) = \max\{k : D_k \leq t\} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{D_k \leq t}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
 Assume that $X_1=10$, $X_2=5$, $X_3=6$ and $S_1 = 17$,
    $S_2=20$ and $S_3=5$, compute the arrival times, waiting times in
    queue, the sojourn times and the departure times for these three
    customers.
  \begin{hint}
     The intent of this exercise is
      to make you familiar with the notation.

      BTW, such simple test cases are also very useful to test
      computer code. The numbers in the exercise are one such simple
      case. You can check the results by hand; if the results of the
      simulator are different, there is a problem.
    \end{hint}
    \begin{solution} Let's feed it to the computer. Mind that in Python (just like in C, and so on), arrays start at index 0, not at index 1. 
\begin{pyconsole}
X = [0, 10, 5, 6] 
S = [0, 17, 20, 5]
A = [0, 0, 0, 0]
for i in range(1, len(X)):
    A[i] = A[i-1] + X[i]

A

WQ = [0, 0, 0, 0]
for i in range(1, len(X)):
    WQ[i] = max(WQ[i-1] + S[i-1] - X[i], 0)

WQ

ST = [0,0,0,0]
for i in range(1, len(X)):
    ST[i] = WQ[i] + S[i]

ST

D = [0, 0, 0, 0]
for i in range(1, len(X)):
    D[i] = A[i] + WQ[i] + S[i]

D
\end{pyconsole}
      
    \end{solution}
  \end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
  If $S\sim U[0,7]$ and $X\sim U[0,10]$, where $U[I]$ stands for the
  uniform distribution concentrated on the interval $I$, compute
  $\P{S-X\leq u}$, for  $S$ and $X$ independent.
  \begin{hint}
  This is elementary, hence it might appear trivial, but it's not\ldots In fact, I had a hard time finding a simple way to get the answer.  It is good practice to try yourself before looking at the answer. Check also the previous problem, and make a drawing of the region over which you have to integrate.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{solution}
The joint density of $S$ and $X$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
  f_{XS}(x, s) = f_X(x) \cdot f_S(s) = \frac{1}{10} \1{0\leq x \leq 10}\cdot \frac 17 \1{0\leq s \leq 7},
\end{equation*}
since $X$ and $S$ are independent. 
Thus, 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  \P{S-X\leq u} &= \E{\1{S-X\leq u}} = \frac{1}{70}\int_0^{10} \int_0^7 \1{s-x\leq u} \d s \d x \\
&= \frac{1}{70}\int_0^{10} \int_0^7 \1{s\leq x+u} \d s \d x.
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}

Now we need to chop up the domain of $\P{S-X\leq u}$, for which we use the figure below.

%\caption{Computing the probability that $S-X\leq u$.}
%\label{fig:P_S_X}
%\end{figure}


It is clear that  the indicated rectangle has no overlap with the set of points $(x,s)$ such that $s\leq u + x$ for $u<-10$. (To see this, draw the line $s=x-10$ in the figure.) At $u=-10$, the overlap is a single point, at $(10,0)$. Thus, 
\begin{equation*}
\P{S-X \leq u}=0, \quad \text{for } u\leq -10.
\end{equation*}

When $u\in[-10, -3]$ we need to integrate over the triangle that results from cutting the line $s=x+u$ with the rectangle. The area is 
\begin{equation*}
70\, \P{S-X \leq u}= \frac{(10+u)^2}2, \quad \text{for } -10 \leq u\leq -3,
\end{equation*}
where we multiply with $70$ to get the normalization right. 

When $u\in[-3, 0]$, we integrate over a parallelogram with base $3+u$ and height $7$ plus the triangle below the line $s=x-3$. The area is 
\begin{equation*}
70\, \P{S-X \leq u}= (3+u)7 + \frac{(10-3)^2}2=7u + \frac{91}2, \quad \text{for } -3 \leq u\leq 0.
\end{equation*}

For $u\in[0, 7]$, we integrate over the trapezoid that results from intersecting the set $\{(x,s) : x \leq s \leq s + u\}$ and the rectangle plus the parallelogram plus the triangle below the line $s=x-3$. The area is 
\begin{equation*}
70\, \P{S-X \leq u}=  \frac{7^2}2 - \frac{(7-u)^2}{2} + 3\cdot 7 + \frac{49}2 = 7 u - \frac{u^2}2 + \frac{91}2, \quad \text{for } 0\leq u\leq 7.
\end{equation*}

Finally, for $u\geq 7$, the set $s\leq x+u$ covers the entire rectangle. Hence, 
\begin{equation*}
70\, \P{S-X \leq u}=  70, \quad \text{for } 7\leq u.
\end{equation*}

Given the amount of effort I had to put into getting this answer, I wanted to check it. So I went to  Wolfram Alpha (which is a great site for symbolic computations), and typed this: 
\begin{verbatim}
\int_{0}^{10} \int_0^7 Boole[s<= x + u]  ds dx,
\end{verbatim}
so, once you know \LaTeX\/ you can use Wolfram Alpha.  Wolfram Alpha turned it to 
\begin{verbatim}
Integrate[Boole[s <= u + x], {x, 0, 10}, {s, 0, 7}]
\end{verbatim}
If you fill this in at Wolfram, you'll get the results that we obtained above in seconds, rather than in one hour or so (depending on your proficiency with carrying out integrals).
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}[\faCalculator]
  Suppose that $X_k\in\{1,3\}$ such that $\P{X_k=1}=\P{X_k=3}$ and
  $S_k\in\{1,2\}$ with $\P{S_k=1}=\P{S_k=2}$. If $W_{Q,0}=3$, what are
  the distributions of $W_{Q,1}$ and $W_{Q,2}$?  
  \begin{hint}
Use Eq.~(\ref{eq:59}).
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}  First find the distribution of $Y_k:=S_{k-1}-X_k$ so that we can write
  $W_{Q,k}=[W_{Q,k-1}+Y_k]^+$.  Use independence of $\{S_k\}$ and $\{X_k\}$:
\begin{align*}
  \P{Y_k=-2} &=\P{S_{k-1}-X_k=-2} = \P{S_{k-1}=1, X_k=3} = \P{S_{k-1}=1}\P{X_k=3} = \frac14.
\end{align*}
Dropping the dependence on $k$ for ease, we get
\begin{align*}
  \P{Y=-2} &=\P{S-X=-2} = \P{S=1, X=3} = \P{S=1}\P{X=3} = \frac14,\\
  \P{Y=-1} &=\P{S=2}\P{X=3} = \frac14,\\
  \P{Y=0} &=\P{S=1}\P{X=1} = \frac14,\\
  \P{Y=1} &=\P{S=2}\P{X=1} = \frac14.
\end{align*}
With this
  \begin{align*}
    \P{W_{Q,1} = 1} &=\P{W_{Q,0} + Y= 1} = \P{3 + Y =1} = \P{Y=-2} =\frac14,\\
    \P{W_{Q,1} = 2} &= \P{3 + Y =2} = \P{Y=-1}  =\frac14,\\
    \P{W_{Q,1} = 3} &= \P{3 + Y = 3} = \P{Y=0}  =\frac14,\\
    \P{W_{Q,1} = 4} &= \P{3 + Y = 4} = \P{Y=1}  =\frac14.\\
  \end{align*}
And, then
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \P{W_{Q,2} = 1} 
&=\P{W_{Q,1} + Y = 1} = \sum_{i=1}^4 \P{W_{Q,1} + Y = 1\given W_{Q,1}=i}\P{W_{Q,1}=i}\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^4 \P{i + Y = 1\given W_{Q,1}=i}\frac14
=\sum_{i=1}^4 \P{Y = 1-i\given W_{Q,1}=i}\frac14\\
&=\frac14\sum_{i=1}^4 \P{Y = 1-i} = \frac14(\P{Y = 0} + \P{Y=-1} +\P{Y=-2}) = \frac{3}{16}.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}

Typing the solution becomes  boring\ldots, let's use the computer\footnote{To run this code, you need to install the lea package. This is a very useful package to help you with all kinds of probability experiments.}.

\begin{pyconsole}
import lea

W = 3
S = lea.vals(1,  2)
S
X = lea.vals(1,  3)
X

# This is WQ1
W = lea.max_of(W + S - X, 0, fast=True)
W

# This is WQ2
W = lea.max_of(W + S - X, 0, fast=True)
W
\end{pyconsole}
Great! Our handiwork matches with the computer's results. 

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


Another set of recursions to compute the arrival and departure times for the single-server queue is the following:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:45}
  \begin{split}
    A_k &= A_{k-1} + X_k, \\
    D_k &= \max\{A_k, D_{k-1}\} + S_k,\\
    W_k &= D_k - A_k.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{exercise} [\faFlask] Why do the recursions of Eq.~(\ref{eq:45}) work? 
  \begin{solution}
 Of course, the service of job $k$ cannot start before it
      arrives. Hence, it cannot leave before $A_k + S_k$. Therefore it
      must be that $D_k \geq A_k +S_k$. But the service of job $k$ can
      also not start before the previous job, i.e. job $k-1$, left the
      server. Thus job $k$ cannot start before $D_{k-1}$. To clarify
      it somewhat further, define $S_k'$ as the earliest start of job
      $k$. Then it must be that $S_k' = \max\{A_k, D_{k-1}\}$---don't
      confuse the earliest start $S_k'$ and the service time
      $S_k$---and $D_k = S_k' + S_k$.
    \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

Once we have the arrival and departure processes it is easy to compute
the \recall{number of jobs in the system} at time $t$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:14}
  L(t) = A(t) - D(t) + L(0),
\end{equation}
where $L(0)$ is the number of jobs in the system at time $t=0$;
typically we assume that $L(0)=0$. Thus, if we were to plot $A(t)$ and
$D(t)$ as functions of $t$, then the difference $L(t)$ between the
graphs of $A(t)$ and $D(t)$ tracks the number in the system, see
Figure~\ref{fig:atltdt}.

Observe that in a queueing system, jobs can be in queue or in
service. For this reason we distinguish between the number in the
system $L(t)$, the number in queue $L_Q(t)$, and the number of jobs in
service $L_s(t)$. If we know $\tilde A(t)$, i.e. the number of jobs that
departed from the queue up to time $t$, then
\begin{equation*}
  L_Q(t) = A(t) - \tilde A(t)
\end{equation*}
must be the number of jobs in queue. The above expressions for $L(t)$
and $L_Q(t)$ then show that the number in service must be
\begin{equation*}
L_s(t) = \tilde A(t) - D(t) = L(t) - L_Q(t).
\end{equation*}



\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
Why don't we need separate notation for $D_s(t)$, the number
    of jobs that departed from the server? 
\begin{solution}
 Because $D_s(t) = D(t)$. Once customers leave the server,
    their service is completed, and they leave the queueing system.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
 Is $\tilde A(t) \leq D(t)$ or $\tilde A(t) \geq D(t)$?
\begin{solution}
 All customers that left the system must have left the
    queue. Thus, $\tilde A(t) \geq D(t)$.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}





\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
 Consider a multi-server queue with $m$ servers. Suppose that
    at some time~$t$ it happens that $\tilde A(t) - D(t) < m$ even though
    $A(t) - D(t) > m$. How can this occur? 
\begin{solution}
 In this case, there are servers idling while there are still
    customers in queue. If such events occur, we say that the server
    is not work-conservative.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}[\faCalculator] It is clear  that $L(t) = A(t)-D(t)$. Show that, when the system starts empty, this implies that
$L(t) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{A_k \leq t < D_k}$.
  \begin{hint}
  Use Boolean algebra.  Write, for notational ease,
    $A=\1{A_k \leq t}$ and $\bar A = 1- A = \1{A_k > t}$, and define
    something similar for $D$.  Then show that
    $A - D = A \bar D - \bar A D$, and show that $\bar A D
    =0$. Finally sum over $k$.
  \end{hint}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      L(t)
&= A(t) - D(t) \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{A_k \leq t} -  \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{D_k \leq t} \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty [\1{A_k \leq t} -  \1{D_k \leq t}].
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  Write for the moment $A=\1{A_k \leq t}$ and
  $\bar A = 1- A = \1{A_k > t}$, and likewise for $D$. Now we can use
  Boolean algebra to see that
  $\1{A_k \leq t} - \1{D_k \leq t} = A-D = A(D+\bar D) -D = AD +
  A\bar D - D = A\bar D - D(1-A) = A\bar D - D \bar A$.
  But $D \bar A = 0$ since
  $D \bar A = \1{D_k \leq t} \1{A_k > t} = \1{D_k \leq t < A_k}$
  which would mean that the arrival time $A_k$ of the $k$th job would
  be larger than its departure time $D_k$. As $A \bar D = \1{A_k \leq t < D_k}$
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      L(t)
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty [\1{A_k \leq t} -  \1{D_k \leq t}] \\
&= \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{A_k \leq t < D_k}.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}

  Boolean algebra is actually a really nice way to solve logical
  puzzles. If you are interested you can find some examples on my
  homepage. 
\end{solution}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[\faFlask] Show  that $L(A_k)>0 \implies A_k \leq D_{k-1}$.
  \begin{hint} Use that $L(A_k)>0$ means that the system contains at least one
  job at the time of the $k$th arrival, and that $A_k \leq D_{k-1}$ means that
  job $k$ arrives before job $k-1$ departs.
  \end{hint}
\begin{solution}  In a sense, the claim is evident, for, if the system contains a
  job when job $k$ arrives, it cannot be empty. But if it is not
  empty, then at least the last job that arrived before job $k$, i.e.,
  job $k-1$, must still be in the system. That is, $D_{k-1} \geq A_k$. A more formal proof proceeds along the following lines. Using that $A(A_k) = k$ and $D(D_{k-1})= k-1$, 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      L(A_k) &> 0 \Leftrightarrow A(A_k) - D(A_k) > 0   \Leftrightarrow k - D(A_k) > 0 \Leftrightarrow k > D(A_k) \\
      &\Leftrightarrow k-1 \geq D(A_k) \Leftrightarrow D(D_{k-1}) \geq D(A_k) \Leftrightarrow D_{k-1} \geq A_k, 
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  where the last relation follows from the fact that $D(t)$ is a
  counting process, hence monotone non-decreasing.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

For the next exercise we need an important definition.
Write $f(x+) = \lim_{h\downarrow0} f(x+h)$ for the right limit of a function $f$ at $x$ and $f(x-) = \lim_{h\downarrow0} f(x-h)$ for the left limit.
Note that $f$ is continuous at $x$ when $f(x-)=f(x+)$.
Since in queueing systems we are concerned with processes with jumps, we need to be quite particular about left and right limits at jump epochs.


\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]\label{ex:25}
 Assume that $X_k = 10$ minutes and $S_k = 11$ minutes for all
    $k$, i.e., $X_k$ and $S_k$ are deterministic and constant. What
    are $\lambda$ and $\mu$?  Compute $A_k$, $W_k$, $D_k$ as functions of $k$. Then find expressions for $A(t)$, $D(t)$, and  $L(A_k-)$. 
  \begin{solution}
 $\lambda=6$ per hour, and $\mu=60/11$ per hour. Note that
      $\mu < \lambda$. $A_0 = 0$, $A_1=10$, $A_2=20$, etc., hence
      $A_k = 10k$. $W_{Q,0} = 0$, $W_{Q,1} = \max\{0 + 0-10,0\} = 0$.
      $W_{Q,2} = \max\{0+11-10,0\} =1$.
      $W_{Q,3} = \max\{1+11-10,0\} =2$. Hence, $W_{Q,k} = k-1$ for
      $k\geq1$. Thus, $W_k = k-1+11 = k + 10$ for $k\geq1$, and
      $D_k = 10k + k+10 = 11k+10$. Note that $W_k$ increases linearly
      as a function of $k$.

      Now, $A(t) = \lfloor t/10\rfloor$, and $D(t) = \lfloor (t-10)/11 \rfloor$. Hence,
      \begin{equation*}
      L(A_k-) = k-1 - D(A_k-) = k- 1 - D(10k-) = k- 1 - \left \lfloor \frac{(10k-)-10}{11} \right \rfloor.
      \end{equation*}
      The computation is a bit tricky since sometimes  arrivals  and  departures coincide. (Consider for instance $t=120$.)

From this example you can infer that it is necessary that the service rate is greater than the arrival rate, i.e.,  $\mu > \lambda$,  for otherwise the queue length keeps on increasing (on the long run).
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}[\faFlask]
 Yet another simple case is to take $X_k=10$ minutes and
    $S_k=9$ minutes for all $k$. Answer the same questions as in the
    previous exercise.
  \begin{solution}
 Trivial.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise} [\faPhoto]
Define the number of jobs in the system as seen by the $k$th arrival  as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Lk}
  L(A_k-).
\end{equation}
(Observe that the $k$th job arrives at time $A_k$ and $\{L(s)\}$ is right-continuous.)
Can you derive the following (algorithmic efficient) procedure to
    compute the number of jobs in the system as seen by arrivals,
  \begin{equation*}
    L(A_k-) = L(A_{k-1}-)+1 - \sum_{i= k-1 - L(A_{k-1}-)}^{k-1} \1{D_i< A_k}?
  \end{equation*} Why do we take $i=k-1-L(A_{k-1}-)$ in  the sum, and not $i=k-2-L(A_{k-1}-)$?
% \hint{ Realize that $L_k = k - 1 - D(A_k)$. 
% what happens to job k-1?
% }
\begin{solution}
  Let $ L(A_{k}-)$, i.e., the number of jobs in the system as
  `seen by' job $k$. It must be that $L(A_{k}-)=k-1 - D(A_{k})$. To see
  this, assume first that no job has departed when job $k$
  arrives. Then job $k$ must see $k-1$ jobs in the system. In general,
  if at time $A_k$ the number of departures is $D(A_k)$, then the
  above relation for $L(A_k-)$ must hold. Applying this to job $k-1$ we get that $L(A_{k-1}-) = k-2 - D(A_{k-1})$. 

  For the computation of $L(A_k-)$ we do not have to take the departures
  before $A_{k-1}$ into account as these have already been
  `incorporated in' $L(A_{k-1}-)$.  Therefore,
  \begin{equation*}
    L(A_k-) = L(A_{k-1}-) + 1 - \sum_{i= k-1 - L(A_{k-1}-)}^{k-1} \1{D_i< A_k}.
  \end{equation*}

    Suppose $L(A_{k-1})=0$, i.e., job $k-1$ finds an empty system at its
    arrival and $D_{k-1}>A_{k}$, i.e., job $k-1$ is still in the
    system when job $k$ arrives. In this case, $L(A_{k}-)=1$, which checks
    with the formula.  Also, if $L(A_{k-1}-)=0$ and $D_{k-1}< A_k$ then
    $L(A_k-) = 0$. This also checks with the formula. 

    The reason to start at $k-1-L(A_{k-1}-)$ is that the number in the
    system as seen by job $k$ is $k-1 - D(A_k)$ (not
    $k-2-D(A_k)$). Hence, the jobs with index from
    $k-1-L(A_{k-1}-), k-L(A_{k-1}-), \ldots, k-1$, could have left the system
    between the arrival of job $k-1$ and job $k$.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


Finally, the \recall{virtual waiting time process} $\{V(t)\}$ is the
amount of waiting that an arrival would see if it would arrive at time
$t$. To construct $\{V(t)\}$, we simply draw lines that start at
points $(A_k, W_k)$ and have slope -1, unless the line hits the
$x$-axis, in which case the virtual waiting time remains zero until
the next arrival occurs.  Thus, the lines with slope $-1$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:waitingtimegg1} show (a sample path of) the virtual
waiting time.


Observe that, just as in Section~\ref{sec:constr-discr-time}, we have
obtained a set of recursions by which we can run a simulation of a
queueing process of whatever length we need, provided we have a
sequence of inter-arrival times $\{X_k\}$ and service times
$\{S_k\}$.  A bit of experimentation with computer programs such as
$R$ or Python will reveal that this is easy.





\begin{exercise}[\faPhoto]
  Provide a specification of the virtual waiting time process $\{V(t)\}$ for
    all $t$.
    \begin{hint}Make a plot of the function $A_{A(t)}-t$. What is the meaning of $V(A_{A(t)})?$ What is
$V(A_{A(t)}) + A_{A(t)}-t$?
    \end{hint}
    \begin{solution}
      There is a funny way to do this. Recall from a previous exercise
      that if $A(t)=n$, then $A_n$ is the arrival time of the $n$th
      job. Thus, the function $A_{A(t)}$ provides us with arrival
      times as a function of $t$. When $t=A_{A(t)}$, i.e., when $t$ is
      the arrival time of the $A(t)$th job, we set
      $V(t) = V(A_{A(t)}) = W_{A(t)}$, i.e., the virtual waiting time
      at the arrival time $t=A_{A(t)}$ is equal to the waiting time of
      the $A(t)$th job. Between arrival moments, the virtual waiting
      time decreases with slope $1$, until it hits 0.  Thus,
      \begin{equation*}
        V(t) 
= [V(A_{A(t)}) - (t-A_{A(t)})]^+= [W_{A(t)} + (A_{A(t)}-t)]^+.
      \end{equation*}
      The notation may be a bit confusing, but it is in fact very
      simple. Take some $t$, look back at the last arrival time before
      time $t$, which is written as $A_{A(t)}$. (In computer code these
      times are easy to find.) Then draw a line with slope $-1$ from
      the waiting time that the last arrival saw.
    \end{solution}
\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise}[\faRocket] Try to extend the recursions~(\ref{eq:45})  to a situation in which one queue is
  served by two servers.  
    \begin{hint} The problem is
      that in a multi-server queueing systems, unlike for
      single-server queues, jobs can overtake each other: a small job
      that arrives after a very large job can still leave the system
      earlier. After trying for several hours, I obtained an inelegant
      method. A subsequent search on the web helped a lot. The
      solution below is a modification of N. Krivulin, `Recursive
      equations based models of queueing systems'. 
    \end{hint}
  \begin{solution}
The recursions for the two-server system are this: 
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
          A_k &= A_{k-1} + X_k, \\
          C_k &= \max\{A_k, D_{k-2}\} + S_k,\\
          M_k &= \max\{M_{k-1}, C_k\}, \\
          D_{k-1} &= \min\{M_{k-1}, C_k\}.
        \end{split}
      \end{equation*}
      Here, $C_k$ is the completion time of job $k$, and $\{D_k\}$ is
      a sorted list of departure times. Thus, $D_k$ is the $k$th
      departure time; recall this is not necessarily equal to the
      completion time $C_k$ of the $k$th job (as jobs may overtake
      each other). To understand the other equations, we reason like
      this.  By construction, $C_k > D_{k-m}$ (as $S_k >0$).
      Therefore, when we arrived at time $C_k$, $(k-m)$ jobs must have
      departed. Moreover, by construction, $M_k$ tracks the latest
      completion time of all $k$ jobs, hence, $M_{k-m+1}$ is the latest
      completion time of the first $k-m+1$ jobs. Therefore, if
      $C_k>M_{k-1}$, job $k$ must leave later than the latest of the
      jobs in $\{1,2,\ldots, k-1\}$.  Hence, the latest departure time
      of the jobs in $\{1, 2, \ldots, k-1\}$ jobs must be
      $M_{k-1}$. If however, $C_k<M_{k-1}$, then job $k$ leaves
      earlier than the latest of the jobs in $\{1,2,\ldots, k-1\}$. As
      $C_k>D_{k-2}$, it must be that $C_k > M_{k-2}$, because
      $D_{k-2}$ is latest departure of the jobs in
      $\{1,2,\ldots, k-2\}$, and this is also equal to $M_{k-2}$. As a
      consequence, if $C_k < M_{k-1}$, job $k$ is also the first job
      that leaves after $D_{k-2}$ ( provided of course that
      $C_{k+1} < C_k$). Thus, all in all
      $D_{k-1} = \min\{M_{k-1}, C_k\}$.

In an attempt to   extend the above to $m>2$ servers, I came up with this scheme:
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
          A_k &= A_{k-1} + X_k, \\
          C_k &= \max\{A_k, D_{k-m}\} + S_k,\\
          M_k &= \max\{M_{k-m+1}, C_k\}, \\
          D_{k-m+1} &= \min\{M_{k-m+1}, C_k\},
        \end{split}
      \end{equation*}
      but it is not correct. Can you find a counterexample?
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}
