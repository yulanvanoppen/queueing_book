There is an important relation between the average time $\E W$ a job
spends in the system and the long-run time-average number $\E L$ of jobs
that is contained in the system, which is called \emph{Little's law}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:53}
  \E L = \lambda \E W.
\end{equation}
Here we provide a sketch of its proof; 
\cite{el-taha98:_sampl_path_analy_queuein_system} provide the details. In
the forthcoming sections we will apply Little's law often. Part of the
usefulness of Little's law is that it applies to all input-output
systems, whether it is a queueing system or an inventory system or
some much more general system.

We start with defining a few intuitively useful concepts.  Clearly, from~\eqref{eq:11}, 
\begin{equation*}
\frac 1 t\int_0^t L(s)\, \d s =  \frac 1 t\int_0^t (A(s)-D(s)) \, \d s
\end{equation*}
is the time-average of the number of jobs in the system during
$[0,t]$. Observe once again from the second equation that
$\int_0^t L(s)\,\d s$ is the area enclosed between the graphs of $A(s)$
and $D(s)$.


The waiting time of the $k$th job is the time between the moment the
job arrives and departs, that is
\begin{equation*}
  W_k = \int_0^\infty \1{A_k \leq s < D_k}\,\d s.
\end{equation*}

We can actually relate $W_k$ to $L(t)$, see
Figure~\ref{fig:atltdt}. Consider a departure time $T$ at which the
system is empty. Observe that $A(T) = D(T)$, as at time $T$ all jobs
that arrived up to $T$ also have left. As for all jobs $k\leq A(T)$
we have that $D_k \leq T$,  we can replace the integration
bounds in the above expression for $W_k$ by
\begin{equation*}
  W_k = \int_0^T \1{A_k \leq s < D_k}\,\d s.
\end{equation*}
Moreover, if $s\leq T$,
\begin{equation*}
L(s) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \1{A_k \leq s < D_k} = \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)}\1{A_k \leq s < D_k}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}
  Show that 
\begin{equation*}
  \int_0^T L(s)\, \d s  =  \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)} W_k.
\end{equation*}
\begin{hint}
  Substitute the definition of $L(s)$ in the left hand side, then reverse the integral and summation.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  \int_0^T L(s)\, \d s & = \int_0^T \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)} 1\{A_k \leq s < D_k\} \, \d s \\
& =  \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)}\int_0^T  1\{A_k \leq s < D_k\} \, \d s =  \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)} W_k.
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Use the result of the previous exercise to show~\eqref{eq:53}. 
\begin{hint}
  Divide both sides by $T$. At the right hand side use that $1/T =  A(T)/T \cdot 1/A(T)$. Take limits.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
From the previous exercise:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac 1 T  \int_0^T L(s)\, \d s  = \frac{A(T)} T \frac{1}{A(T)} \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)} W_k.
\end{equation*}
Assuming there are an infinite number of times
$0\leq T_i<T_{i+1}<\cdots$, $T_i\to\infty$, at which $A(T_i) = D(T_i)$
and the following limits exist
\begin{align*}
\frac 1 T  \int_0^T L(s)\, \d s &\to \E L,&
\frac{A(T_i)}{T_i} &\to \lambda, &
\frac{1}{A(T_i)} \sum_{k=1}^{A(T_i)} W_k &\to \E W,
\end{align*}
we obtain  Little's law.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
 Which assumptions have we used to prove Little's law?
  \begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 
 $A(t)/t \to \lambda$ as $t\to \infty$, i.e., $A(t)/t$ has a limit as $t$ converges to $\infty$. 
  \item There exists a sequence of points $T_k, k=0,1,2,\ldots$ in time such that the server is idle. 
  \item Either of the limits $\sum_k^n W_k/n = \sum_k^n S_k /n $ or
    $t^{-1}\int_0^t L(s) \d s$ exists, in which case the other exists.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Observe that the area between the graphs of $A(s)$ and $D(s)$ must
be equal to the total waiting time spent by all jobs in the system
until $T$. Use this to  provide a graphical interpretation of the proof of Little's law.
  \begin{hint}
 Make a drawing of $A(t)$ and $D(t)$ until time $T$, i.e., the
    first time the system is empty. Observe that $A(t)-D(t)$ is the number of jobs in the system. Take some level $k$, and compute $A_k = A^{-1}(k)$ and $D_k = D^{-1}(k)$. Observe that $D_k - A_k = D^{-1}(k) - A^{-1}(k)$ is the waiting time of job $k$.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{solution}
    The area enclosed between the graphs of $A(t)$ and $D(t)$ until
    $T$ can be `chopped up' in two ways: in the horizontal direction
    and the vertical direction. (Please make the drawing as you go
    along\ldots) A horizontal line between $A(t)$ and $D(t)$
    corresponds to the waiting time of a job, while a vertical line
    corresponds to the number of jobs in the system at time $t$. Now
    adding all horizontal lines (by integrating along the $y$-axis)
    makes up the total amount of waiting done by all the jobs until
    time $T$. On the other hand, adding the vertical lines (by
    integrating along the $x$-axis) is equal to the summation of all
    jobs in the system. Since the area is the same no matter whether
    you sum it in the horizontal or vertical direction:
    \begin{equation*}
      \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)}  W_k = \text{enclosed area} = \int_0^T (A(t)-D(t))\,dt. 
    \end{equation*}
 Dividing both sides by $A(T)$ gives
    \begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{A(T)} \sum_{k=1}^{A(T)}  W_k =\frac{1}{A(T)} \int_0^T (A(t)-D(t))\,dt. 
    \end{equation*}

    Finally, observe that this equality holds between any two times
    $T_i, T_{i+1}$, where times $\{T_i\}$ are such that
    $A(T_i)=D(T_i)$. Then, as $T_i\to \infty$ which we assumed from
    the on-set, $\frac{1}{A(T_i)} \sum_{k=1}^{A(T_i)} W_k\to \E W$,
    and
    \begin{equation*}
\frac{T_i}{A(T_i)}\frac{1}{T_i} \int_0^{T_i} (A(t)-D(t))\,dt \to \lambda^{-1} \E L.
    \end{equation*}
Hence, Little's law follows.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Use the dimensions of the components of Little's law to check that $\E{W} \neq \lambda \E{L}$.
  \begin{hint}
Checking the dimensions in the formula  prevents painful mistakes.
  \end{hint}
  \begin{solution}
  Sometimes (often?) students memorize Little's law in the wrong
  way. Thus, as an easy check, use the dimensions of the concepts:
  $\E L$ is an average \emph{number}, $\lambda$ is a \emph{rate},
  i.e., \emph{numbers per unit time}, and $\E W$ is waiting
  \emph{time}. 
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
As a useful first application, consider the server of a $G/G/1$ queue
as a system by itself. Show that the average number of jobs in service~$\E{L_S}$ is equal to the utilization~$\rho$. 
\begin{solution}
 Assume the system is rate-stable, for otherwise
all relevant limits do not exists.  The arrival rate at the server is
$\lambda$ and the time a job remains in at the server is $\E S$. Thus, the average time a job remains in the `box' that identifies the server is $\E S$, and then the average number of jobs at the server is $\E{L_S} = \lambda \E S$, by Little's law. As $\lambda \E{S} = \rho$, we get
$\E{L_S} = \rho$.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  For a given single server queueing system the average number of
  customers in the system is $\E L = 10$, customers arrive at rate
  $\lambda=5$ per hour and are served at rate $\mu=6$ per hour.
 What is the average time customers spend in the system?
  \begin{hint}
Start with checking the units when applying Little's law.
  \end{hint}
    \begin{solution}
 This was my initial answer (which is wrong):
        `$\E W = \lambda \E L = \lambda 10$'.  Interestingly, I typed
        in Little's law in the wrong way\ldots So, be aware! It's all
        too easy to make mistakes with Little's law.

    This is correct: 
    \begin{equation*}
      \E W = \E L/\lambda = 10/\lambda = 10/5 = 2.
    \end{equation*}
    \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  For the  single server queueing system of the previous exercise, 
 suppose that at the moment you join the system, the number of
    customers in the system is 10. What is your expected time in the
    system? 
 Why is this answer different from the answer of the previous exercises?
    \begin{solution}
If you arrive at a queueing system, you first have to wait until the job in service is finished.  Then you need to wait until the 9 jobs in queue are finished. This takes, in expectation, $9/\mu$. (Recall, 1 job is in service at the moment you arrive, so 9 are in queue.) Assuming that service times are exponential, so that, by the memoryless property, the remaining service time of the job in service is still $\E S$ when you arrive, you spend $10/\mu + 1/\mu = 11/6 \neq 2$. (To account for the last $+1/\mu$, observe that yourself also have to be served to compute the time you spend in the system.)


Now  in this question, it is \emph{given} that the system
    length is 10 at the moment of arrival. However, $L$ as `seen' upon arrival by this
    given customer  is in general  not the same as the  time-average $\E{L}$.

Thus, Little's law need  not hold at all moments in time; it is a statement about \emph{averages}.
    \end{solution}

\end{exercise}

Here is a summary of the most useful results and concepts of this and the previous sections
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrival rate,  departure  rate, rate stability:  $\lambda = \delta$
\item PASTA: $\lambda \pi(n) = \lambda(n) p(n)$,
\item Recursions $\lambda(n)p(n) = \mu(n+1) p(n+1)$,
\item Renewal reward: $Y=\lambda X$
\item Little's law: $\E L =\lambda \E W$.
\end{itemize}
We will use these results time and again in the sequel.
